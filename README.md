# Project Summary
Final Project for Stanford Course CS 147: Introduction to Human Computer Interaction Design.
We designed an experience that allows users to:
1. Share audio snippets throughout their days
2. Listen to audios posts from friends
3. Comment on audio posts

## Why we chose this project
Storytelling has long been a popular vessel of communication, from the archaic traditions of passing down information through song to the modern day traditions of Youtube and Tik Tok “storytimes” that are pervasive across the internet. Whether it’s the casual nature of these video stories or the expressiveness of the individuals in recalling them, it’s clear that they’re a popular favorite among youth, especially because of how contrasting they are with the perfectly curated photographs of most social media mediums today. 

This then begs the question of how to evoke one’s voice in creating a platform for casual and natural expression. In thinking about this project, our team wanted to create a sort of antithesis to Instagram that would contrast the toxic culture of many social media platforms, and instead encourage the normalization of imperfect stories, moments, and responses through voice. Simply put, we wanted to design an Instagram for voice memos that mirrored the casual nature of “finstas” or “fake instagrams.”

In thinking about how to design this, we considered the cultural and descriptive norms of Instagram that we were attempting to break. On platforms like Instagram, there’s an expectation that content is curated, and that your profile is a depiction of how incredible and perfect your life appears. Even vulnerability is cloaked with precision and planning, thus discouraging authentic discourse about the not-so-picture-perfect parts of one’s daily life. In order to combat this and reduce the barrier to posting casually, we decided to focus on ridding the notion of visual aesthetic entirely. We believed that focusing on voice as a medium of expression would create a safer space for individuals to share, respond to, and voice frustrations with each other.
